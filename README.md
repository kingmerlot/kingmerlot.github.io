### What exactly is the yeagerists plan/goal?
Their initial goal was to reunite Eren Yeager with his half-brother, Zeke Yeager, and form the “New Eldian Empire” as well as assisting Eren in his effort of activating the Rumbling.
> The two brothers have different goals from their plan                                    

### Zeke Plan
Zeke's plan consists of sterilizing all of the Subjects of Ymir ( which means the Eldians) -- so that they won't be able to have offsprings, thus there will be no more Titans.

### Eren Plan
Eren's goal is to eliminate the entire world except for Paradis, but keeping his fellow Paradisans alive is also extremely important to him, especially his close friends. After all, the elimination of his 'enemies' means nothing if the people he wants to protect aren't safe when it's all over.

### Why Did eren make that plan?
 Eren's main goal is to protect the people inside of the walls, and he thinks that if he can eliminate all existing threats outside of the walls, Paradis will be safe for generations to come.
 
 
### Is Eren Really become an antagonist?
Eren reveals that he turned the bad guy so that he could make Armin and the alliance the heroes who saved humanity from extinction by stopping him. In short, he wanted to die at the hands of his friends in order to guarantee their freedom. He sacrificed his life and freedom for theirs.
